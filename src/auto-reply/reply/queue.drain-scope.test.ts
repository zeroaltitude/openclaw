// The followup drain outlives its enqueue request across debounce and retries, but
// its continuation must not inherit the triggering request's AsyncWorkScope. A
// drained queued turn runs an agent run whose embedded-agent-runner entry bridges
// through the ambient scope tracker (run-orchestrator.ts trackOwner pattern), so
// if the drain inherits the request scope, tracked work in the drained turn
// rejects with "Async work scope is closed" once the request settles. The drain
// error is neither deferred nor a restart signal, so the drain loop logs and
// reschedules against the same closed scope forever, silently dropping the queued
// follow-up. A detached continuation owns a fresh async work scope instead.
