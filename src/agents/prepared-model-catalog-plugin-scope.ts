/**
 * Which plugins may contribute to a model catalog (openclaw-crb2).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The prepared-model-catalog worker had no gateway request scope, so its
 * registry load fell through to `metadataSnapshot.pluginIds` — *every* installed plugin.
 * Measured on a live gateway: 156 plugins, 55 actually loaded, **44.6 seconds**, inside a
 * throwaway worker thread, with real side effects (it opened `graph-context.db` and
 * registered channel hooks). Terminating that worker mid-import is the suspected trigger for
 * V8 `Check failed: node->IsInUse()`, which aborts the WHOLE gateway process and kills every
 * in-flight agent run.
 *
 * THE DANGER, AND HOW THIS MODULE ANSWERS IT. Narrowing the plugin set risks *silently*
 * dropping models from the catalog — a worse failure than the crash, because nothing
 * announces it. Two deliberate choices contain that:
 *
 *   1. **Be greedy.** Any manifest signal that could plausibly contribute provider or model
 *      surface keeps the plugin. We are optimising away `beads`, `slack`, `discord` and
 *      `browser` — plugins with no provider signal whatsoever — not shaving the set to a
 *      minimum. A false *include* costs milliseconds; a false *exclude* loses a model.
 *   2. **Fail crashing, never silently.** {@link assertModelCatalogCoversExpectedProviders}
 *      compares what the catalog actually produced against what the manifests said to expect
 *      and THROWS on any shortfall. A wrong scope becomes a loud, attributable error naming
 *      the missing providers instead of a quietly shorter model list.
 *
 * Everything here reads the manifest metadata snapshot, which is built WITHOUT importing any
 * plugin — so computing the scope costs nothing and cannot itself trigger the bug.
