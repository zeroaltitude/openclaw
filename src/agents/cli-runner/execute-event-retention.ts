// Bounds on the per-run state the CLI event consumers retain.
//
// `cli-output-tool-tracker.ts` bounds what the *parser* holds. These bound what
// the parser's consumers hold: `createCliEventHandlers` keeps a summary entry
// per distinct tool call plus the start arguments of every call whose result has
// not arrived, and `createCliToolTracking` keeps one active-tool entry per
// unfinished non-server tool call. All of that used to be bounded only by how
// long a turn could stream, because a spent turn budget stopped the parser from
// delivering any further records at all. It no longer does — a spent budget now
// keeps projecting tool starts and results so the gateway's stall detector still
// sees progress — so these are the direct bound on the consumer side of that
// path.
//
// Two eviction policies, chosen per structure and not interchangeable:
//
//  - FIFO eviction, matching `cli-output-tool-tracker.ts`. Its worst case is a
//    summary or argument entry for a call that last appeared thousands of calls
//    earlier. Used where the oldest entry is the least useful one.
//  - Refuse-new past the cap, never evicting. Used for the maps that describe
//    which tools are still RUNNING, where the oldest entry is the long-lived
//    foreground `Agent` call whose attributed progress keeps the recovery clock
//    alive. Evicting there would re-create the abort this branch exists to
//    prevent, so a pathological stream loses tracking for the newest tool
//    instead of for the one that matters.
