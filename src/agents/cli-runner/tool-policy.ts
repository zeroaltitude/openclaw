 * through execution arguments has a complete, gateway-held offered set. For
 * `claude-cli` that cap becomes `--tools <native,discovery>` plus
 * `--allowedTools mcp__openclaw__*`, and the run's bundled MCP config is reduced to
 * the OpenClaw loopback server alone under `--strict-mcp-config`, so every other
 * name the CLI can call carries the mediated prefix. An uncapped run
 * (`cliToolAvailability === undefined`) instead hands its configured MCP servers to
 * the CLI, whose tool names live nowhere in this shape: its offered set is unknown
 * here, and callers must read `undefined` as "no claim", never "offered nothing".
 *
 * Discovery is included even though a node-placed run drops it, because a name
 * wrongly believed to be offered only loses the claim, while a name wrongly believed
 * unoffered would exempt a call that really ran.
