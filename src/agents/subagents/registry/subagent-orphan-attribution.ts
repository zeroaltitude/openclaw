 * Causal attribution for subagent runs orphaned by a gateway death.
 *
 * A run that was in flight when the gateway process disappeared is only
 * discovered later, when a fresh boot sweeps the registry. The reap timestamp
 * is therefore an arbitrarily late clock reading: it includes however long the
 * host stayed down. Describing the run's lifetime with it produces a confident
 * lie — a 5-minute run that died in a 34-minute outage reads as a 40-minute
 * run, which is exactly the evidence that talked one earlier investigation into
 * diagnosing a timeout on a run whose timeout was disabled.
 *
 * This module turns boot-lifecycle history that is already persisted into a
 * specific, causal message. It records what it observed and what it merely
 * bounded, and it never computes elapsed time from the reap.
