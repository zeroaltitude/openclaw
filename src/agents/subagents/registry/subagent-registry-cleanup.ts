 * True while this run is in the durable, non-terminal-cleanup `child-unconfirmed`
 * state: it was completed on a deadline alone and nothing was ever observed to
 * stop the child.
 *
 * The registry row is terminal so the parent gets woken, but the child may still
 * be running, so **no terminal effect may run against it**: not the
 * `sessions.delete` that removes its session and transcript, not its attachments
 * directory, not its browser sessions, not its MCP runtimes, not the internal
 * session-effects teardown, not the context-engine "this child ended" report,
 * not the exactly-once terminal plugin hooks, and not the detached task's
 * terminal state — `shouldApplyRunScopedStatusUpdate` rejects
 * `timed_out` -> `succeeded`, so a published `timed_out` is the one projection a
 * later observed success could never repair.
 *
 * Only authoritative stop evidence promotes the row out of this state, never a
 * clock, and never the mere absence of a record. Two owners produce that
 * evidence:
 *
 * - **push** — a later lifecycle callback settles the run; the published
 *   provisional timeout is explicitly not preserved against it
 *   (`shouldPreservePublishedExplicitRunTimeout`), and the promotion reopens
 *   cleanup so the withheld effects finally run.
 * - **pull** — the sweeper re-reads the child's own persisted session entry
 *   (`settleSubagentRunFromSessionStore`). A terminal status there promotes the
 *   row; a `running` status defers it again, and an *absent* entry defers it too,
 *   so retention never deletes a child that is still alive and
 *   `archiveAfterMinutes: 0` keeps its documented no-auto-archive meaning.
