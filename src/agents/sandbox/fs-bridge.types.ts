   *   grants, read-only carveouts, and protected-path policies must be

   * - `pinnedPath`: the canonical mutation target in the bridge's runtime
   *   namespace. Pass it back as `pinnedPath` on the mutation so the pinned
   *   operation lands on exactly the authorized location.
   *
   * The two paths differ when the runtime resolves sandbox aliases onto
   * different host roots. Pinned mutations walk their path without following
   * symlinks, so any component swapped after resolution fails the mutation
   * instead of redirecting it.
   *
   * Directory semantics: for `mkdir` both paths describe the directory
   * itself (which an existing alias may rename); for file-backed actions
   * (`write`, `create`, `remove`, `copy-destination`) both paths describe the
   * canonical parent plus the requested basename, so the basename never
   * changes.
