/**
 * Whether this invocation's transport failure decides the tool call's fate.
 *
 * A `permission_request` the child abandons is not a failed tool call. The child
 * treats a missing hook decision as "no decision" and falls through to its own
 * native approval path (see runNativeHookRelayPermissionRequest's closing noop),
 * so the person may still approve there and the tool then runs normally. Telling
 * the run owner the call timed out would be a claim about an outcome the parent
 * never observed — and the projection wins over the real terminal event, so a
 * call that actually succeeded would still be reported as failed.
 *
 * A `post_tool_use` the child abandons is not a failed tool call either, for the
 * stronger reason: the call already ran, and Codex's PostToolUse outcome cannot
 * block, delay, or mutate it. The child's own fail-closed path agrees — only
 * `pre_tool_use` and `permission_request` render a deny when the relay is
 * unreachable (renderNativeHookRelayUnavailableResponse); `post_tool_use` renders
 * the noop. So no reading of an abandoned post-tool-use hook makes "this tool
 * call failed" true, while the projection still outranks the real terminal event.
 *
 * Every other event keeps projecting. `pre_tool_use` in particular must: when the
 * child abandons that hook it manufactures its own fail-closed deny, so the tool
 * call genuinely did not run and the run owner has to hear about it.
 *
 * `before_agent_finalize` is deliberately absent. It carries no tool call — the
 * Stop payload has no tool and nothing on that path reads toolUseId — so the
 * caller's own `params.toolCallId` guard already suppresses it, and naming it
 * here would add a branch no regression could hold.
 *
 * An unreadable event is treated as projectable, which is the pre-existing
 * behavior. It cannot mask an approval in practice: the bridge parses the event
 * before it parses the payload the tool call id comes from, so a request that
 * produced a tool call id always produced its event too.
 *
 * Both projection sites consult this. The bridge records a transport failure for
 * an invocation that never produced a response, and the relay entrypoint projects
 * for the same invocation when the bridge's abort unwinds it; whichever lands
 * first wins the per-tool-call dedupe, so gating only one leaves the bug intact.
