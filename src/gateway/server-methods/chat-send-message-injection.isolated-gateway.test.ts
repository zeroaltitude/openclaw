/**
 * Isolated-gateway proof for the #128971 terminal-receipt steer fence
 * (round-8 ClawSweeper evidence request).
 *
 * Round-8 blocked the PR on mock-only evidence again: the round-7 proof
 * replaced `dispatchInboundMessage` and the seam mock then constructed a test
 * follow-up run, scheduled its queue, and called `sendFinalReply` itself —
 * proving the mock's branch, not that a rejected steer reaches the production
 * dispatcher and produces a real outbound result. This file now drives that
 * real boundary:
 *
 *  - a real `installConnectedControlUiServerSuite` loopback Gateway with a
 *    real authenticated WebSocket client (no live credentials, no live
 *    channel);
 *  - the real `chat.send` RPC handler driving the real admission fence —
 *    the production handler path, not the admission starter called directly;
 *  - a real persisted session entry carrying a terminal tombstone for the
 *    active source turn (real session store + real receipt classifier);
 *  - the real `replyRunRegistry` recording the active source-turn identity;
 *  - the real `beginReplyMessageInjectionTarget` (spied) — the fence must
 *    reject before it queues anything;
 *  - the REAL production dispatcher: `dispatchInboundMessageMock` is reset
 *    (no implementation), so the gateway test module mock passes through to
 *    `dispatchInboundMessageWithProjectedDispatcher` — production
 *    `dispatchReplyFromConfig` pipeline, production reply delivery owner
 *    (`ReplyDispatcher` → chat transcript/finalization → `broadcastChatFinal`);
 *  - only the reply SOURCE is controlled: `mockGetReplyFromConfigOnce`
 *    supplies one deterministic reply payload (the same seam every gateway
 *    server-chat test uses to drive the real dispatcher deterministically;
 *    it replaces the LLM/agent-run reply source, not the delivery owner);
 *  - the REAL transport: the loopback WebSocket to the connected test client.
 *    The client records the `chat` wire events the production broadcast path
 *    emits and asserts exactly one outbound final carrying the reply text.
 *
 * The test never constructs a follow-up run, never schedules a queue, and
 * never calls `sendFinalReply`. The asserted reply is produced and delivered
 * by the production dispatcher and observed on the real wire transport.
 *
 * The wire-level assertions show: the inbound is rejected at the injection-
 * start boundary (zero steer enqueues into the live run), the rejected steer
 * reaches the production dispatcher exactly once (one reply-resolver
 * invocation carrying the inbound body and `messageInjectionDisposition:
 * "rejected"` — the fresh-turn disposition), and the production delivery
 * owner emits exactly one outbound final over the real transport (one
 * `chat.final` event carrying the reply text). A positive control (unrelated
 * historical tombstone) shows the steer is enqueued, an unknown-source
 * regression (retained tombstone, no source identity) shows the steer is
 * rejected to exactly one follow-up final, and a before-fix control
 * (classifier weakened) shows the silent-loss race.
