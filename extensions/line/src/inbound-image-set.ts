// Line plugin module groups the durable claims LINE splits one multi-image send into.
import { enqueueKeyedTask } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/keyed-async-queue";

// LINE does not deliver several images picked in one action as one message. It
// sends one webhook event per image, ties them together with an imageSet id, and
// does not deliver them in order. Handled one at a time they become N concurrent
// turns for a single user action: the agent cannot answer about the set, and the
// turns contend so one of them ends with no reply at all.
//
// The parts are buffered here, at the ingress boundary that owns their durable
// claims, so the set reaches the handler as one delivery whose ownership spans
// every claim behind it.
//
// `index` and `total` are both optional in LINE's own contract, and `index` is
// documented absent for senders on LINE 11.15 or earlier for Android - so completion
// can never be assumed and the timer, not the count, guarantees a set is delivered.
//
// The shared `createInboundDebouncer` buffers by key and serializes by key too,
// while a set needs two: the buffer is per sender's set so one member's images
// cannot join another's turn, and the order queue is per lane so a message
// released behind the set still waits for it. Its window also starts when an
// item is buffered, and this one starts after the lane is entered, so time spent
// queued behind earlier work on the lane is not charged to the gap between
// parts. Its flush also runs on a bare timer, detached from the delivery
// callback, while this turn has to stay inside the ingress admission the spool
// pump holds open. Per-key serialization itself is the shared helper's.
//
// The delay bounds the gap between parts of one send, not a whole upload, so it
// is generous next to the sub-second gaps LINE was measured delivering.
