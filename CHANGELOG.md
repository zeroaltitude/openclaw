# Changelog

**Why this looks different:** the project was renamed from **Clawdis → Clawdbot**. To make the transition clear, releases now use **date-based versions** (`YYYY.M.D`) and the changelog is **compressed** into milestone summaries. Full detail still lives in git history and the docs.

## Unreleased

### Breaking
- **SECURITY (update ASAP):** inbound DMs are now **locked down by default** on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Discord/Slack.
  - Previously, if you didn’t configure an allowlist, your bot could be **open to anyone** (especially discoverable Telegram bots).
  - New default: DM pairing (`dmPolicy="pairing"` / `discord.dm.policy="pairing"` / `slack.dm.policy="pairing"`).
  - To keep old “open to everyone” behavior: set `dmPolicy="open"` and include `"*"` in the relevant `allowFrom` (Discord/Slack: `discord.dm.allowFrom` / `slack.dm.allowFrom`).
  - Approve requests via `clawdbot pairing list --provider <provider>` + `clawdbot pairing approve --provider <provider> <code>` (Telegram also supports `clawdbot telegram pairing ...`).
- Timestamps in agent envelopes are now UTC (compact `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ`); removed `messages.timestampPrefix`. Add `agent.userTimezone` to tell the model the user’s local time (system prompt only).
- Model config schema changes (auth profiles + model lists); doctor auto-migrates and the gateway rewrites legacy configs on startup.
- Commands: gate all slash commands to authorized senders; add `/compact` to manually compact session context.
- Groups: `whatsapp.groups`, `telegram.groups`, and `imessage.groups` now act as allowlists when set. Add `"*"` to keep allow-all behavior.

### Fixes
- Onboarding: write auth profiles to the multi-agent path (`~/.clawdbot/agents/main/agent/`) so the gateway finds credentials on first startup. Thanks @minghinmatthewlam for PR #327.
- Docs: add missing `ui:install` setup step in the README. Thanks @hugobarauna for PR #300.
- Build: import tool-display JSON as a module instead of runtime file reads. Thanks @mukhtharcm for PR #312.
- Browser: fix `browser snapshot`/`browser act` timeouts under Bun by patching Playwright’s CDP WebSocket selection. Thanks @azade-c for PR #307.
- Browser: add `--browser-profile` flag and honor profile in tabs routes + browser tool. Thanks @jamesgroat for PR #324.
- Telegram: stop typing after tool results. Thanks @AbhisekBasu1 for PR #322.
- Messages: stop defaulting ack reactions to 👀 when identity emoji is missing.
- Auto-reply: require slash for control commands to avoid false triggers in normal text.
- Auto-reply: flag error payloads and improve Bun socket error messaging. Thanks @emanuelst for PR #331.
