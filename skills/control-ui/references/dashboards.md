## Recommended build sequence

1. Read the board.
2. Create tabs only when the existing structure does not fit.
3. Put each widget on its final tab with a stable name.
4. Move and resize after content exists.
5. Pin the session.
6. Focus the intended tab.
7. Choose a split or expanded dashboard panel.
8. Read again, then verify the rendered UI.

The Dashboard tool's focus and presentation commands need a connected Control
UI. They can return unavailable even though board storage is healthy.
`focus_tab` opens the side panel. Call `set_presentation` after focusing the tab:
`presentation: "expanded"` expands it; `"split"` restores a split view using the
current panel layout.

## Updating content

For a custom widget, call `show_widget` again with:

- `pin: true`;
- the same explicit `name`;
- the replacement `widget_code`;
- the existing tab and intended size.

This updates content without discarding the widget's board position. A content
change creates a new revision and may invalidate prior capability approval.

Use `dashboard widget_put` only for registered plugin kinds. It is not a second
HTML-authoring path.

## Dashboard panel and sidebar behavior

The session is the durable sidebar object. A board is not a separate session or
navigation page.

- `sessions patch` can pin and organize the session.
- `dashboard focus_tab` broadcasts a focus command. A connected Control UI
  opens the dashboard panel and saves the session's dashboard preference.
- **Expand side panel** fills the task area; **Collapse** brings chat back beside
  the dashboard. Closing the panel returns to chat alone.
- Sessions with a stored board appear in the `/dashboards` gallery, regardless
  of their saved view. Selecting a card opens its owning chat with the dashboard
  panel expanded.

The active tab and side-panel layout are per-device UI state. The dashboard
preference is server-side session state.

## Verification checklist

- Correct session key and label.
- Expected dashboard panel and tab.
- Stable widget names, correct owners, and current revisions.
- Layout is usable at desktop and narrow widths when relevant.
- Widget frame loaded; no sandbox-origin or ticket error.
- Interactive controls perform their intended action.
- Capability prompts or grants match the widget's declared needs.
