# fastlane setup (OpenClaw iOS)

Install the pinned Ruby bundle:

```bash
cd apps/ios
# Install Ruby 3.4.10 with mise or another .ruby-version-aware manager.
ruby --version
gem install bundler -v 4.0.21
bundle _4.0.21_ install
bundle _4.0.21_ check
```

The expected runtime is recorded in `apps/ios/.ruby-version`, and the Gemfile
enforces the same Ruby version. Fastlane and dependency checksums are pinned in
`apps/ios/Gemfile.lock`.

Repository commands use that bundle automatically:

```bash
pnpm ios:screenshots
pnpm ios:release:plan -- --json
pnpm ios:release:archive -- --version 2026.7.2 --revision 1 --build-number 3
```

An inherited `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` does not override the repository bundle.
Repository commands require `apps/ios/Gemfile` and fail if it is missing.
Restore a missing Gemfile from the repository checkout. If the locked bundle is
unavailable, run the setup commands above and retry.

Create an App Store Connect API key:

- App Store Connect → Users and Access → Keys → App Store Connect API → Generate API Key
- Download the `.p8`, note the **Issuer ID** and **Key ID**

Recommended (macOS): store the private key in Keychain and write non-secret vars:

```bash
scripts/ios-app-store-connect-keychain-setup.sh \
  --key-path /absolute/path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 \
  --issuer-id YOUR_ISSUER_ID \
  --write-env
```

This writes these auth variables in `apps/ios/fastlane/.env`:

```bash
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID=YOUR_KEY_ID
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID=YOUR_ISSUER_ID
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE=openclaw-app-store-connect-key
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEYCHAIN_ACCOUNT=YOUR_MAC_USERNAME
```

Important: `apps/ios/fastlane/.env` is only for Fastlane/App Store Connect auth and optional release-archive settings. It does **not** configure gateway-side direct APNs push delivery for local iOS builds.

Optional app targeting variables (helpful if Fastlane cannot auto-resolve app by bundle):

```bash
APP_STORE_CONNECT_APP_IDENTIFIER=ai.openclawfoundation.app
# or
APP_STORE_CONNECT_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_STORE_CONNECT_APP_ID
```

File-based fallback (CI/non-macOS):

```bash
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID=YOUR_KEY_ID
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID=YOUR_ISSUER_ID
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_PATH=/absolute/path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
```

Code signing variable (optional in `.env`):

```bash
IOS_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=YOUR_TEAM_ID
```

Tip: run `scripts/ios-team-id.sh --require-canonical` from repo root to verify the canonical OpenClaw iOS team (`FWJYW4S8P8`) is available locally. Fastlane uses the same canonical-only path when `IOS_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` is missing, and rejects non-canonical teams for release archives.

App Store release signing is manual and profile-pinned. The canonical manifest is `apps/ios/Config/AppStoreSigning.json`, and Fastlane `match` owns the encrypted signing repo and branch named there.

One-time or rotation setup:

```bash
pnpm ios:release:signing:plan
pnpm ios:release:signing:check
pnpm ios:release:signing:setup
```

`signing:setup` uses Fastlane `produce` and `modify_services` to create Developer Portal bundle IDs and enable required services before running `match`. The main app also requires App Attest, and the main app and share extension both require the shared App Group from `apps/ios/Config/AppStoreSigning.json`; associate that group with both bundle IDs in the Apple Developer Portal before regenerating profiles. If Fastlane does not already have a valid Apple Developer Portal session, run `cd apps/ios && BUNDLE_GEMFILE="$PWD/Gemfile" bundle _4.0.21_ exec fastlane spaceauth` for a release-owner Apple ID and export the resulting `FASTLANE_SESSION`.

Shared encrypted signing storage:

```bash
MATCH_PASSWORD=... pnpm ios:release:signing:sync:push
MATCH_PASSWORD=... pnpm ios:release:signing:sync:pull
```

The signing repo is private and encrypted. Store `MATCH_PASSWORD` in the release-owner vault, not in this product repo. `sync:pull` uses Fastlane `match` to decrypt, install profiles, and import the distribution signing identity into the local Keychain.

For local/manual iOS builds that stay on direct APNs, configure the gateway host separately with `OPENCLAW_APNS_TEAM_ID`, `OPENCLAW_APNS_KEY_ID`, and either `OPENCLAW_APNS_PRIVATE_KEY_P8` or `OPENCLAW_APNS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`. Those gateway runtime env vars are separate from Fastlane's `.env`.

Validate auth:

```bash
cd apps/ios
BUNDLE_GEMFILE="$PWD/Gemfile" bundle _4.0.21_ exec fastlane ios auth_check
```

App Store Connect API auth is required when:

- uploading to App Store Connect
- planning the App Store revision and next build from App Store Connect

If you pass `--build-number` to `pnpm ios:release:archive`, the local archive path does not need App Store Connect API auth.

Archive locally without upload:

```bash
pnpm ios:release:archive -- --version 2026.7.2 --revision 1 --build-number 3
```

Generate deterministic App Store screenshots:

```bash
pnpm ios:screenshots
```

The screenshot lane runs the app with `--openclaw-screenshot-mode`, which enters the built-in connected screenshot fixture instead of pairing with a live gateway. By default it chooses an available large iPhone model and a 13-inch iPad model from the installed Xcode runtime; override the model selection with a comma-separated `OPENCLAW_SNAPSHOT_DEVICES` value when the requested simulators exist locally.

The lane builds the UI-test products once, creates a fresh simulator for each selected model and runtime, and runs each screenshot in an independent `xcodebuild test-without-building` session against those products. It shuts down and deletes each owned simulator before creating the next, including the final Watch capture, and refuses to start while another simulator is running. Xcode command logs stay in `apps/ios/build/SnapshotLogs`; result bundles and the capture-attempt ledger stay in `apps/ios/build/SnapshotTestResults`. See [screenshot-only validation](../VERSIONING.md#screenshot-only-validation) for hosted branch runs and opt-in sanitized diagnostics.

Each screenshot gets one capture attempt. A failed capture or Xcode test result stops the lane, retaining its attempt record and any result bundle for diagnosis. CI rejects replacement captures as passing release evidence.

Screenshot tests disable Xcode's verbose failure diagnostics, such as sysdiagnose, while retaining command logs, screenshots, and per-attempt result bundles.

CI pins SimSlim 0.8.0 for the selected iPhone test simulator and iPhone/iPad
screenshot devices. It disables only search and family services. Preparation
must succeed before capture; Watch and default local runs remain stock.

From a clean local `main` matching `origin/main`, upload to App Store Connect:

```bash
pnpm ios:release:upload
```

The entry point plans the release, generates reviewed notes from changes since
the latest public build, and uploads the unchanged source SHA. It saves the
notes artifact without editing tracked files or creating commits. After Apple
processing it stages the saved notes and selects the build. Direct Fastlane
upload is disabled. Notes generation requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Native release qualification

On an Apple Silicon Mac with `/Applications/Xcode.app`, an available iOS simulator
runtime supporting iPhone 17 Pro and arm64, and the repository's pinned native tools installed:

```bash
node --import ./scripts/tsx.mjs scripts/ios-release-e2e.ts \
  --mode stock --target-sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --output /tmp/ios-e2e-stock.json

./scripts/install-simslim.sh /tmp/ios-e2e-tools
OPENCLAW_CI_SIMSLIM_BINARY=/tmp/ios-e2e-tools/simslim \
  node --import ./scripts/tsx.mjs scripts/ios-release-e2e.ts \
  --mode compare --target-sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --output /tmp/ios-e2e-compare.json
```

The gate requires a clean tracked and untracked source tree at the exact SHA;
gitignored build outputs are allowed. It selects the newest available iOS runtime
that supports the test device and architecture, and records that runtime in its proof.
It builds the Gateway runtime and ad-hoc-signed
Debug `OpenClawUITests` simulator products once. Ad-hoc signing preserves Keychain
entitlements without certificates or provisioning profiles; this is not a signed
Release build. Each arm starts an isolated real Gateway, then prepares its setup
handler and state worker with `device.pair.setupStatus` before booting one new
simulator. This status preparation prunes expired completion records without issuing
a credential. After boot, the same Gateway issues the fresh setup code consumed by
the app. The live test pairs a fresh install and
verifies the `first` and `second` message round trips. It then terminates and
relaunches the app, verifies the `relaunch` message on the restored connection,
and opens native Overview. Each message must reach the deterministic local
`openai/ios-e2e` provider fixture as the latest user request.

The harness then stops the Gateway and provider fixture and runs the deterministic
keyboard/transcript reader test on the same simulator. Its first fixture send checks
that the transcript remains rendered above the open keyboard and follows the new
reply. Its second, multiline send checks keyboard dismissal, retained draft text,
reply anchoring, jumping to the latest reply, and returning after manual scrolling.
Control UI is disabled; this does not replace external-provider validation.

To reuse native products for another complete qualification at the same source and
toolchain, pass `--build-dir /absolute/path/to/ios-e2e-build` to both invocations.
The build owner verifies the source, toolchain, build arguments, and product integrity
before reuse. Each qualification still creates fresh simulator and Gateway resources.
The explicit build directory retains native products and their receipt; it does not
retain raw XCTest results.

For a narrower local diagnostic, use either:

```bash
# Prepare native products without starting a simulator or Gateway.
node --import ./scripts/tsx.mjs scripts/ios-release-e2e.ts \
  --mode stock --target-sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --build-dir /tmp/ios-e2e-build --build-only --output /tmp/ios-e2e-build.json

# Exercise Gateway startup, setup-status preparation, and code issuance without native resources.
node --import ./scripts/tsx.mjs scripts/ios-release-e2e.ts \
  --mode stock --target-sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --gateway-only --output /tmp/ios-e2e-gateway.json
```

These diagnostics produce `native-build`/`built` or `gateway-probe`/`probe-passed`
proofs, respectively. Neither is release qualification. Gateway runtime preparation
continues to use the existing build owner's cache in every mode.

The stock gate runs in **iOS Store Release** after native tool setup and before signing
assets are accessed. It qualifies the checked-out `main` commit used for release
preparation and records the installed Xcode version and build without requiring
a specific Xcode version. Manual CI also requires the stock gate when
`validation_tier=full` and its checkout revision equals the workflow run's SHA.
Main-tier and alternate-target manual runs retain their existing coverage.
Existing compatibility admission still excludes historical and
pinned-target CI paths; this does not claim universal pinned-target FRV coverage.
Local direct upload behavior is unchanged.

Manual dispatch of `iOS Release E2E` qualifies the selected workflow revision;
it does not accept an alternate target SHA. CI callers must also use their own
revision.

Compare runs four serial matched pairs in stock/slim, slim/stock, stock/slim,
slim/stock order, for eight independently prepared arms. SimSlim keeps the existing
conservative search/family-only profile. A preparation or live-test failure stops
that arm before the reader test; a reader failure also fails the arm. Neither
failures nor skipped tests are retried or dropped. Cleanup runs once per arm,
and unconfirmed cleanup stops the run. JSON retains each attempted test's outcome
and duration, plus preparation, arm, build, and overall durations; the workflow
also records shared toolchain installation time.

Qualification tests disable Xcode's verbose failure diagnostics, such as sysdiagnose,
while retaining ordinary XCTest output, result inspection, and sanitized proof.

Both comparison arms sample `simslim measure --json` every second after boot and
preparation, through the test window only. The peak is the largest sampled
simulator-process-tree `phys_footprint`, not RSS, whole-host memory, a continuous
peak, or reboot-preparation memory. Missing/invalid samples or gaps over three
seconds fail measurement. A stock gate without the meter requires no measurements.
Raw XCTest bundles and fixture logs stay private and are cleaned with owned
resources. If owned cleanup cannot be confirmed, the working root is retained.
Only sanitized JSON proof is uploaded, including on failure, with fixed operation
labels, phase durations, setup RPC progress, and bounded exit/error diagnostics.
Raw logs and setup codes are excluded. Setup-code timeouts are preparation failures
and prevent native test execution.

## GitHub Actions

Run **iOS Store Release** from `main` using the `ios-store-release` environment.
The workflow has no input parameters and uses the same
`pnpm ios:release:upload` entry point. It installs the pinned build tools, uses
readonly encrypted signing assets and a job-owned temporary keychain, and
uploads screenshots, the App Review PDF attachment, and the IPA. After Apple
processing it stages the saved release notes and selects the exact build.
App Review submission remains manual. For a failure after upload, use
[staging recovery](../VERSIONING.md#staging-recovery); do not repeat the upload.

Repository/environment secrets required by name:

- `GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `MATCH_PASSWORD`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_CONTENT`

App Store Connect supplies the revision and next build number. No TestFlight
group ID or manually prepared mobile release branch is required.

Local authentication setup for a fresh clone on the same Mac:

1. Reuse the existing Keychain-backed App Store Connect key on that machine.
2. Restore or recreate `apps/ios/fastlane/.env` so it contains the non-secret variables:

```bash
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID=YOUR_KEY_ID
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID=YOUR_ISSUER_ID
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE=openclaw-app-store-connect-key
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEYCHAIN_ACCOUNT=YOUR_MAC_USERNAME
```

3. Re-run auth validation:

```bash
cd apps/ios
BUNDLE_GEMFILE="$PWD/Gemfile" bundle _4.0.21_ exec fastlane ios auth_check
```

4. Inspect the live plan if needed, then run the release entry point:

```bash
pnpm ios:release:plan -- --json
pnpm ios:release:upload
```

Quick verification after upload:

- confirm the exported IPA exists under `artifacts/` in the printed recovery directory
- confirm Fastlane validates the exported IPA before upload
- confirm Fastlane prints `Uploaded iOS App Store build: version=<version> short=<short> build=<build>`
- submit the processed build for App Review manually in App Store Connect

Versioning rules:

- App Store release uploads derive the gateway from root `package.json` and revision/build state from App Store Connect
- The planner accepts checked `--version`, `--revision`, and `--build-number` overrides; no release arguments are required
- Store notes come from the saved, reviewed Git-history artifact; `apps/ios/CHANGELOG.md` remains historical documentation
- Gateway versions use CalVer: `YYYY.M.PATCH`
- Fastlane appends one unpadded revision digit: gateway `YYYY.M.PATCH`, revision `R`, becomes `YYYY.M.PATCHR`
- Gateway `2026.7.2`, revision `1` sets `CFBundleShortVersionString` to `2026.7.21`
- Fastlane resolves `CFBundleVersion` from the maximum awaiting, processing, failed, or complete build-upload record plus one
- The notes baseline is the build attached to the latest public App Store version, independent of later TestFlight uploads
- `pnpm ios:version:check` validates version inputs without requiring changelog notes
- The release flow regenerates `apps/ios/OpenClaw.xcodeproj` from `apps/ios/project.yml` before archiving
- Local App Store signing uses a temporary generated xcconfig with profile names from `apps/ios/Config/AppStoreSigning.json` and leaves local development signing overrides untouched
- App Store release uses `OpenClawPushMode=appStore`, which derives the canonical production hosted relay, production APNs, production relay profile, and `appleStrict` proof. The release lane rejects custom production relay URL overrides.
- The exported IPA is validated before upload by inspecting its push mode, signed entitlements, and embedded App Store profile.
- `pnpm ios:release:upload` stages screenshots and the App Review PDF attachment before uploading the IPA, waits for processing, then stages saved notes and selects the build. It does not submit for App Review or upload the App Store Connect `Notes` field
- See `apps/ios/VERSIONING.md` for the detailed workflow
