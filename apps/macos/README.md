# OpenClaw macOS app (dev + signing)

## Quick dev run

```bash
# from repo root
scripts/restart-mac.sh
```

Options:

```bash
scripts/restart-mac.sh --no-sign   # fastest dev; ad-hoc signing (TCC permissions do not stick)
scripts/restart-mac.sh --sign      # force code signing (requires cert)
scripts/restart-mac.sh --background-only # keep services running without automatic windows
```

`--background-only` suppresses first-run onboarding, update and CLI prompts, and
the `--chat`/`--dashboard` auto-open helpers. Pairing, control-channel, and Mac
node services still start. It also keeps GUI-owned onboarding and saved Gateway
profile Keychain state cold, so a signer or ACL transition cannot raise a
SecurityAgent prompt during unattended work. The primary Gateway route still
comes from the normal environment/config endpoint. Combine it with
`--attach-only` when an external process owns the local Gateway.

## App profiles

Launch a fully isolated app instance with the same profile name used by the CLI:

```bash
OPENCLAW_PROFILE=work /Applications/OpenClaw.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenClaw
```

Profile names use 1–64 lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens and
must start with a letter or number. `default` selects the normal app; `gateway`,
`mac`, and `node` are reserved LaunchAgent identities.

`scripts/restart-mac.sh` intentionally rejects named profiles because its
packaging cleanup is host-global. Build/package normally, then launch the named
profile directly with the command above.

A named profile keeps state in `~/.openclaw-<name>`, uses its own app defaults,
Keychain services, duplicate-instance lock, and the CLI-managed Gateway service
`ai.openclaw.<name>`. Unless config or environment selects a port, each profile
derives a stable port in the profile `20000...59999` range. The app does not
install or modify the host-global Mac node
service or OpenClaw login item while a profile is active. The runtime child node
still runs in process as usual. App relocation, Sparkle updates, and post-update
service repair are disabled in profile mode; update the installed app through
the normal default-profile workflow.

## Packaging flows

Development bundle (signed but not notarized):

```bash
scripts/package-mac-app.sh
```

This creates `dist/OpenClaw.app` and signs it via `scripts/codesign-mac-app.sh`.
It is not a distribution artifact. For a notarized app ZIP and DMG, use:

```bash
scripts/package-mac-dist.sh
```

For an unattended Peekaboo elevation host, use the closed Foundation signing
profile and source-addressed ZIP workflow. `package` is an internal release
operator command: it requires the OpenClaw Foundation signing identity and
notarization credentials, and its archive is not a general-download artifact.

```bash
scripts/mac-elevation-host.sh package
cd dist/elevation-host
shasum -a 256 -c "OpenClaw-<full-source-sha>-stable.zip.sha256"
shasum -a 256 -c "OpenClaw-<full-source-sha>-stable-installer.sh.sha256"
./OpenClaw-<full-source-sha>-stable-installer.sh install \
  --archive "OpenClaw-<full-source-sha>-stable.zip"
./OpenClaw-<full-source-sha>-stable-installer.sh status
```

The elevation package is ZIP-only, notarized and stapled, contains exactly
`OpenClaw.app`, omits Apple Events entitlements, records an immutable receipt,
and verifies a freshly extracted copy. The same source-addressed artifact set
includes an executable installer copied from that exact Git commit plus separate
archive and installer checksum files, so a target Mac does not need a source
checkout. Transfer the complete set and verify both checksums before running the
installer. Installation owns the separate
`ai.openclaw.mac.elevation-host` launchd job with `RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive`.
It refuses to replace or race the ordinary `ai.openclaw.mac` Launch at login
job. `recover` restores the recorded prior bundle after a failed cutover;
`uninstall` removes only the elevation job and preserves the app, state,
Keychain, TCC, and recovery receipt. Installation exits successfully once the
launchd-owned process is Bridge-ready; missing TCC remains a degraded `status`
result until the required grants are present.

## Signing behavior

Auto-selects identity (first match):
1) Developer ID Application
2) Apple Distribution
3) Apple Development
4) first available identity

If none found:
- errors by default
- set `ALLOW_ADHOC_SIGNING=1` or `SIGN_IDENTITY="-"` to ad-hoc sign

## Team ID audit (Sparkle mismatch guard)

After signing, we read the app bundle Team ID and compare every Mach-O inside the app.
If any embedded binary has a different Team ID, signing fails.

Skip the audit:
```bash
SKIP_TEAM_ID_CHECK=1 scripts/package-mac-app.sh
```

## Library validation workaround (dev only)

If Sparkle Team ID mismatch blocks loading (common with Apple Development certs), opt in:

```bash
DISABLE_LIBRARY_VALIDATION=1 scripts/package-mac-app.sh
```

This adds `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` to app entitlements.
Use for local dev only; keep off for release builds.

## Useful env flags

- `SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)"`
- `ALLOW_ADHOC_SIGNING=1` (ad-hoc, TCC permissions do not persist)
- `CODESIGN_TIMESTAMP=off` (offline debug)
- `DISABLE_LIBRARY_VALIDATION=1` (dev-only Sparkle workaround)
- `SKIP_TEAM_ID_CHECK=1` (bypass audit)
