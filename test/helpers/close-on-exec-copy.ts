// Fixture tree copy helper for trees whose files tests execute directly.
import fs from "node:fs";

/**
 * Clone a fixture tree without leaking writable descriptors into child processes.
 *
 * Without a filter, Node 24 copies directories through std::filesystem, which
 * ignores `mode` and opens copies without O_CLOEXEC. A sibling Vitest thread
 * that forks during the copy keeps the file writable, so a later execve of it
 * fails with ETXTBSY. Any filter keeps new files on libuv's close-on-exec
 * copyFileSync; the clone mode does the same for overwritten files.
