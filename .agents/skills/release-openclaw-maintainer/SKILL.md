# OpenClaw Release Maintainer

Use for a release operation, not ordinary development or advisory mutation.
Read `docs/reference/RELEASING.md` for current policy. Load `$release-private`
when available before resolving private credential locators or host topology;
credential operations use `$one-password`.

## Choose the operation

Read only the references needed for the selected phase:

- Regular beta/stable preparation or publication: [regular release](references/regular-release.md), which routes preparation and phase-specific proof. If the request does not specify stable/full, default to beta; beta authorization does not authorize later stable promotion.
- Backport discovery: [candidate inventory](references/backport-discovery.md). For extended-stable also read [backport preparation](references/extended-stable-backports.md); SDK/config changes need a visible maintenance-risk warning and maintainer decision.
- Extended-stable `.33+` Gateway publication: [extended-stable publication](references/extended-stable-publish.md). Use the shared publisher with extended-stable inputs; its non-Latest GitHub Release carries evidence without native-app or ClawHub publication.
- Validation selection or failed proof: [validation and confidence](references/validation.md), with `$release-openclaw-ci` for workflow execution and immutable manifests.
- Interrupted publication or registry promotion: [publication recovery](references/publication-recovery.md).
- Native assets: [platform publication](references/platform-publication.md), with `$release-openclaw-mac` for macOS operations.
- Stable postpublish synchronization and the exact-SHA deployment handoff:
  [main closeout](references/stable-main-closeout.md).
- Release notes: `$openclaw-changelog-update`, including its separate approved post-release docs-mirror route. Initial release generation keeps its existing format; docs publication does not run automatically during release. Requested announcements: `$release-openclaw-announcement` for Discord, `$release-tweets` for X. Announcements never gate publication and require explicit posting authorization.
- Published artifact verification: `$verify-release`. GHSA operations: `$openclaw-ghsa-maintainer` only with explicit security-workflow authorization.

## Shared release boundaries

Every selected validation lane must succeed: Windows and macOS Node and other
normal CI jobs, install smoke, survivor
lanes, `update-first-hop-compat*`, pack/npm qualification, package integrity,
and Linux/Windows/macOS Gateway checks, including Windows packaged
install/upgrade checks in Release Checks. A cancelled run still blocks. Preserve
first failures and classify each one as below before recovery. Stable
publication requires stable/full evidence, soak, and blocking performance.
Beta-profile evidence cannot authorize stable publication. No lane or soak
waiver can bypass these requirements. All nine Gateway install/upgrade
combinations across Linux, Windows, and macOS are required for all-group
qualification. Preserve identity, provenance, complete evidence, and existing
publication approvals.

Every failed test gets an explicit lead decision, real release blocker or
flake, recorded in the handoff with its evidence: the same SHA passing
elsewhere or on rerun, no relation to the release delta, a runner or infra
signature, a history of the same case flaking, or a pre-existing product bug
that is not a regression (for example the 2026.9.6 "Assign to…" bug). A real
blocker is a regression in shipped bytes or behavior, or an update/install/
publish defect; fix it on the release branch. Rerun a flake on
the same Release SHA with at most two recorded reruns by default, and file a
fix-in-parallel issue or PR on `main` with the evidence. Never re-cut, change
tooling, or start a new FRV for a flake. A flake that remains red blocks publication. Main-only failures and infrastructure
failures (runner outages, GitHub ghost jobs, hosted-runner offload) count as
flakes for the release.

Dependency advisories never delay a release. A newly published advisory is
never a reason to re-cut, change tooling, or rerun validation. Record it in the
release evidence and handoff, then file or queue the dependency bump on `main`
as a normal follow-up after publication. Only a known-malware finding stops
publication. Release dependency evidence and release-dispatched CI enforce this.

Main's CI health never gates a release. Validation and publication run from the
release branch plus pinned tooling, so a red `main` is not a reason to wait,
re-cut, or pause. When the release needs a release-tooling fix on `main`
(tooling SHAs must be trusted `main` commits), `main` failures the fix does not
cause must not hold that landing: prove on a clean `main` checkout that the
failure already exists there, record it in the PR body, and merge. During an
active release, an admin merge is allowed for a release-tooling PR in exactly
that situation. Red `main` still gets fixed, in parallel by a separate lane,
never on the release's critical path.

The operating objectives are approximately 20 minutes to seal validation and
publication within an hour, not measured guarantees. Source-only children start
alongside artifact producers; candidate consumers start as soon as the candidate
is ready. Independently sealed green children can be reused for the same exact
target and inputs even when their parent failed, was cancelled, or remains active;
verify their original admitted qualification identity (or historical trusted-main
workflow SHA) and current attempt. The sealed
manifest supplies the SDK evidence digest and npm publication decisions; it
never acknowledges SDK API changes, so supply
`plugin_sdk_api_acknowledgement` whenever the SDK report contains changes. The
publisher cannot accept waived validation evidence. Explicit
publisher inputs select publication scope; the candidate helper still validates its explicit
SDK acknowledgement when needed.

Explicit approval is required for version changes and irreversible publication.
A request to cut, publish, or complete a named release carries through its
validated publication and verification; do not ask again unless identity,
channel, scope, or material risk changes. Ship authority for ordinary code is
not release authority.

An operator's explicit approval to do whatever is needed to prepare a named
release is standing authority for the necessary preparation decisions and
repairs. Carry it through candidate and tooling fixes, upgrade/migration design,
reviewed test or security-inventory alignments, isolated proof, commits, pushes,
and validation recovery. Record the decision, its evidence, and the selected
support contract; do not ask again merely because an already-approved class of
work reaches an implementation or verification step. Continue independent work
while resolving a blocker. This authority does not permit hiding defects,
lowering a gate to manufacture success, destructive changes to operator state,
unrelated work, or publication. A prepare-only request still requires a separate
publication instruction before releasing artifacts or a bridge version.

Keep one compact state record using
[the handoff template](references/release-handoff-template.md): effective goal,
version/tag/branch, cut/Code/Release SHAs, C/Q/P identities, active parent run and attempt,
successful child artifacts, approved changes, phase and next action. Latest
operator steering replaces superseded scope. Completed evidence stays complete
until a named change invalidates it.

For regular releases, prepare complete notes before freezing **Code SHA** when
possible. If those notes are final, **Code SHA and Release SHA are the same
commit**: one successful fresh full qualification can supply both roles and
their exact publication bytes. Do not create another commit or run solely to
separate the labels. If notes change after qualification, a descendant whose
complete delta includes `CHANGELOG/<version>.md` (exact beta version or stable
base) and only that entry, its
matching record, and root index may use `split-changelog-release-v1`
to reuse product proof while qualifying new publication bytes. Any other
source delta, rename, or deletion returns to the Code SHA loop. Historical
root-only receipts retain `changelog-only-release-v1`.
New qualification freezes **Q=C**: the entire qualification workflow closure
belongs to the candidate. Keep independently trusted **P** (admission, verifier,
and publisher) separate. A Q harness repair requires a new C/Q and newly bound
evidence; P-only or infrastructure repairs can preserve the candidate. Missing
qualification contracts need a deliberate backport, never future-main fallback.

Once a candidate is cut, its base is the operator's decision. Never re-cut
(re-base the candidate on newer `main`) unless Peter explicitly asks for it in
that release. Without asking, cherry-pick already-merged `main` commits onto
the release branch only to fix a confirmed release blocker: a required lane
failing deterministically on the frozen candidate, or an update/install/
publish-bytes defect. Name each cherry-pick in the handoff record. Not allowed:
opportunistic backports, feature reverts, or a new base taken to "pick up" a
fix that cherry-picks cleanly enough with a small conflict resolution.

Release process improvements made during a release land on both branches.
Workflow, release-script, release-test, `RELEASING.md`, and release-skill changes
merge to `main` first, then get cherry-picked (`-x`) onto `release/YYYY.M.PATCH`
for the next candidate or patch. A qualification repair needed for this release
must land before freezing a new C/Q; never silently swap the harness for an
already qualified candidate. Where `main`-only CI infrastructure is missing on the branch,
keep the branch's expression form and port only the logic. Product code on the
release branch stays blocker-only per the rule above.

A release is not done while anything opened for it is still open. Before the
final report, list every PR created during the release (`gh pr list --author
@me --state open` plus any PR bound to the session) and land or explicitly close
each one with a reason; confirm its fix is on `main` and, when it is release
tooling, on the release branch. Also remove the release's temporary worktrees,
abandoned local cut branches, and stale `scripts/pr` worktrees.

Published versions and final tags are immutable. Reuse successful exact-source
artifacts; do not rebuild or republish as an implicit retry. The active release
is the work queue: no opportunistic moving-main fixes or backports. Classify
failures, repair their owner, retry the affected surface, then reassess rather
than repeating the full release.

Required publication proofs and enforced environment approvals remain required.
A passing sibling cannot replace missing required evidence. npm + ClawHub is the
priority path. macOS, Windows, Linux, and Android native publication runs in
parallel and never gates npm/ClawHub, GitHub release finalization, or main closeout.
Selected Windows Node, Linux/Windows/macOS Gateway, and native-app CI failures
block release validation. Platform publishers retain their own artifact
and updater contracts; report pending platforms and proof gaps accurately.
