# Release validation and confidence

Use `$release-openclaw-ci` for workflow dispatch, manifests, and failed-child
recovery. Select the phase below; deferred or omitted checks are not passed.
Every selected child needs terminal evidence. A required failure cannot be
waived by success on another surface.

## Older updater checks

Before freezing a release, refresh `scripts/lib/update-compat-inventory.json`
from every release in the supported upgrade window. Verify each downloaded npm
tarball against its published `dist.integrity` before extraction, then run
`pnpm update:compat:gen --release '<unpacked-dir>=<verified-integrity>'`, repeating
`--release` for every supported version. Generation replaces the recorded set:
keep empty entries, drop expired versions and their historical corrections, and
never hand-edit recorded origins. Run `pnpm update:compat:check`; both npm
`latest` and `beta` must be covered. Repeat the generation arguments with
`--check` for an offline regeneration check.

Run every recorded `update-first-hop-compat*` lane and the upgrade survivor lane
from the oldest supported release. Native Windows proof must invoke the old
updater with a registered Scheduled Task and verify that it restarts the Gateway
without a later manual `gateway start`.

## Source and package gates

Before tagging or publishing, complete the relevant source/package checks:

```bash
pnpm release:fast-pretag-check
pnpm check:architecture
pnpm build
pnpm ui:build
pnpm qa:otel:smoke
pnpm release:check
pnpm test:install:smoke
```

Use existing equivalent exact-SHA release evidence; do not repeat successful
checks solely because this list mentions them. Source CI, including `pnpm check`,
`pnpm check:test-types`, and cross-OS outcomes, must pass when selected for npm/ClawHub validation.
Artifact, install-smoke, survivor, first-hop, pack/npm qualification, target,
and provenance proofs remain required. Code SHA and Release SHA may be the
same commit when it contains final notes; the same successful full parent
qualifies that source and its exact publication bytes. Only a later
CHANGELOG-only descendant may reuse earlier product evidence through the
changelog-only policy, while qualifying its changed package bytes.

`release:fast-pretag-check` protects package-root README, plugin-local runtime,
and npm/ClawHub metadata contracts. Fix real packaging defects before tagging.
For newly publishable packages, read [first-package registry
preparation](first-package.md); do not discover missing ownership during publish
or consume the next beta with ad-hoc bootstrap publication.

Keep plugin `openclaw.release.requireLatestDependencies` declarations. Upstream
latest drift/unavailable lookups are advisory: retain the tested Codex pin and
record warnings. Malformed runtime metadata, package/install failures and
required validation failures still block.

Dependency advisory findings in release dependency evidence and
release-dispatched CI audits are warnings at every severity; only known malware
blocks. Record them in the handoff and queue the bump on `main` after
publication; never re-cut, change tooling, or rerun validation for them.

Install smoke also checks pack budget and direct npm global fresh/update paths;
keep those enabled. `OPENCLAW_INSTALL_SMOKE_SKIP_NONROOT=1` is the existing
non-root-skip mode, not permission to skip install proof. Published correction
versions must prove upgrade from their base stable package. Postpublish use:

```bash
OPENCLAW_NPM_EXPECTED_WORKFLOW_REF=refs/tags/release-publish/<tooling-sha12>-<epoch> \
OPENCLAW_NPM_EXPECTED_WORKFLOW_SHA=<tooling-sha> \
node --import tsx scripts/openclaw-npm-postpublish-verify.ts <published-version>
```

Run it from a checkout of the Release SHA once the registry lists the version
(see [regular release](regular-release.md#publish-and-verify)).

`pnpm qa:otel:smoke` supplies local OTLP/redaction coverage without hosted
telemetry credentials. Video-provider checks are conditional on release scope:
`pnpm test:live:media video` is bounded default coverage; explicit FAL coverage
uses `--video-providers fal`. Full transform modes require intentional
`OPENCLAW_LIVE_VIDEO_GENERATION_FULL_MODES=1`. Use `$one-password` before
credentialed tests. Local live model/Parallels rosters require both OpenAI and
Anthropic keys; missing either blocks those lanes, never print their values.

### Bundled Chrome MCP artifacts

The bundled Chrome MCP artifact checker selects a trusted, exact patch-byte
contract from the candidate's declared dependency pin and requires the bundled
manifest to match it. The supported contracts are `1.8.0` (shipped in
`v2026.9.6` at `eb377ac59e6c9fd6c7705028034812becf00271b`) and `1.9.0`.
Both retain their original runtime hashes, required assets, ESM manifest, and
bundled CLI resolution checks. Ranges, unknown versions, mixed contracts, and
artifact-supplied hash tables cannot authorize a payload. Retain the `1.8.0`
contract while supported frozen release targets pin it; retire it explicitly
when those targets retire or migrate to a qualified newer pin, not merely when
main updates its dependency. This does not change the candidate dependency or
waive any package acceptance gate.

## Beta and stable qualification

Use `release_profile=beta`, `run_release_soak=false` for beta. Stable publication
requires `release_profile=stable` or `full`, soak, and blocking performance.
Beta-profile evidence cannot qualify stable publication. A qualifying `all` run for
an actual beta on its canonical branch/tag records `npm-beta-v1`. Native app
CI, performance, and published-package Telegram move to confidence. Node,
Control UI, plugin, cross-OS, QA parity, runtime-pair/restart, and tool coverage
remain selected and blocking; package/install/update proofs remain
enforced. Beta `all` without soak
also defers Package Acceptance Telegram, broad live/E2E, QA-live and Parallels.
Package Telegram deferral applies to beta-profile `main` too, but it does not
qualify for `npm-beta-v1`.

FRV `normalCi` Windows Node shards are policy-advisory (`windows-node-ci`).
Eligible `normalCi` failures with authenticated `recorded-flake` receipts are
also advisory; all other selected failures block. Decide blocker or flake for
every failure, rerun flakes on the same Release SHA at most twice, and file a
fix-in-parallel issue/PR on `main`. Do not re-cut, change tooling, or start another
FRV for a flake. See the [CI skill](../../release-openclaw-ci/SKILL.md#publication-requirements).
Other children and package/install/update, artifact, and evidence gates stay
strict; extending classification beyond `normalCi` is follow-up work.
Native platform publication remains independent and follows its own gates.
All-group cross-OS qualification requires all nine Linux/Windows/macOS
install/upgrade pairs. Focused recovery may select individual lanes but does
not itself qualify publication. No lane or soak waiver can bypass failures.

## Postpublish confidence

Target the exact published beta with `run_release_soak=true` or focused groups.
This phase owns deferred native apps, performance, Telegram, QA-live, broad
Docker/live E2E and Parallels:

- Verify registry/provenance and install/update of the published package,
  including Docker coverage.
- Dispatch **NPM Telegram Beta E2E** from main with
  `package_spec=openclaw@<beta-version>`, `provider_mode=mock-openai`; require
  success. Its shared QA secrets use `qa-live-shared`, not npm publish approval.
  Local `pnpm test:docker:npm-telegram-live` with matching package spec and
  Convex CI environment is a debugging/fallback path.
- Use `$openclaw-parallels-smoke` for published-package install/update with both
  provider keys. Keep plugin installs enabled; disabling them proves no
  plugin/dependency release contract.
- Credentialed channel QA uses **QA-Lab - All Lanes**
  (`qa-live-transports-convex.yml`) against the published tag. SHA targets must
  satisfy its main-ancestor/open-PR-head credential trust gate. It covers mock
  parity, live Matrix and Convex-leased Telegram. After later fixes, rerun
  touched surfaces; rerun this workflow for channel, credential or QA-harness
  changes. Do not substitute unrelated local proof.

A confidence failure does not retroactively unpublish a beta. Classify it and
admit a confirmed product fix only to a new operator-approved candidate.

## Stable-publish and bounded execution

Stable promotion requires successful stable/full qualification for the exact
source, including soak and blocking performance. Beta confidence may inform
diagnosis but cannot substitute for required stable evidence.

Preserve the validation parent and successful children when continuation is
eligible; parents that produced sealed candidate artifacts need a new parent
with verified evidence reuse. Diagnose failures and retry only the affected
surface within the controller's budget. Classify every selected test failure as
a real blocker or a flake under the
[shared release boundaries](../SKILL.md#shared-release-boundaries): flakes get
bounded recorded reruns on the same Release SHA and a fix-in-parallel issue or
PR on `main`. Change Code SHA only for a real blocker and validate the repaired
source. Aim to seal within approximately 20 minutes
and publish within an hour; report observed blockers and timing rather than
claiming those objectives as measured guarantees.

Selected validation tests block the npm/ClawHub decision on failure. Native
publication retains independent artifact and updater gates.

Local proof is targeted: never mirror Full Release Validation locally. Run a
lane locally only after it failed in CI, to separate flake from defect, bounded
to 15 minutes per lane; a lane that needs longer reruns in CI through its
focused `rerun_group`. Individual npm install/update phases cap at 300 seconds.
On timeout, inspect the affected lane instead of leaving it running. Serialize
build/package mutations before VM packing so a concurrent build cannot remove
`dist`; avoid load-induced noise.

Fix related required failures at their owner and rerun affected evidence. For
PR preparation/landing or observed hosted-runner stalls, use
`$openclaw-pr-maintainer` / `$openclaw-ci-limits`; never synthesize prepare
artifacts or replace canonical `scripts/pr` with PR-controlled scripts. Record
unrelated main failures instead of adopting them into release scope.

## Immutable runtime generation proposal

A durable replacement would install each version in an immutable generation
directory and switch an installation pointer. Launchers must resolve that
pointer before starting Node so lazy imports keep the process's original tree.
Retain generations until their processes have exited. This is a proposal, not
the current update layout.

The design must preserve npm's ownership and bookkeeping: `npm ls -g`, later
global installs and uninstall, lifecycle scripts, and generated launchers must
still work. Unix uses `<prefix>/lib/node_modules` and `<prefix>/bin`; Windows
uses `<prefix>/node_modules` and prefix-root launchers. A mutable junction alone
does not pin old imports, and Windows pointer replacement must respect open
handles and junction semantics. npm must not replace or orphan the retained
generation anchor during its next install.

pnpm owns a global project, manifests, lockfiles, virtual-store links, and
version-dependent package groups; its cleanup must not collect live generations.
Bun also owns a shared global project and separate binary directory, and its
Windows binary launchers currently cannot be relocated by this updater.
Generation activation must preserve sibling packages and the existing
concurrent-project checks for both managers. These constraints need separate
design approval and package-manager integration proof before implementation.
