/**
 * Real-runtime proof for PR #126924 — "distinguish a subagent wait expiring from
 * the child dying".
 *
 * Run:
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/proof-126924-subagent-wait-expiry-not-death.ts
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL HERE
 * - The production subagent registry singleton (`src/agents/subagents/registry/
 *   subagent-registry.ts`): the real `registerSubagentRun` launch path, the real
 *   run-wait loop on real wall-clock timers, the real completion pipeline, and
 *   the real sweeper driven through the exported
 *   `scheduleSubagentRegistrySweep`. No vitest, no fake timers.
 * - The real detached task registry. `registerSubagentRun` creates the task row
 *   itself, and every status write goes through the real
 *   `updateTaskStateByRunId` / `shouldApplyRunScopedStatusUpdate` transition
 *   rules. That matters: those rules are precisely why publishing `timed_out`
 *   is irreversible, so a mocked task runtime could not prove this fix.
 * - The real session store. Each child's own session row lives in a real SQLite
 *   store under a temp `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, written through the real
 *   `replaceSessionEntry` and read back by the real
 *   `settleSubagentRunFromSessionStore`. The "absent snapshot" scenario uses a
 *   child that genuinely has no row on disk — not a stubbed return value.
 *
 * WHAT IS STUBBED, AND ONLY THIS
 * - `subagentRegistryDeps.callGateway` — the WebSocket edge that would reach the
 *   child agent's own run. `agent.wait` answers `{ status: "timeout" }` with no
 *   terminal snapshot, which is exactly the deadline-only expiry under test.
 *   Every request is recorded, so the proof asserts on what the production code
 *   actually submitted — notably whether any `sessions.delete` was sent for a
 *   child that may still be live.
 * - `subagentRegistryDeps.captureSubagentCompletionReply` — the child's own
 *   transcript. It answers from a scripted per-session map so the proof can tell
 *   pre-expiry partial output apart from the child's real final output. The seam
 *   under test (`freezeRunResultAtCompletion`'s first-write-wins capture and the
 *   promotion that must clear it) is entirely real; only the transcript text is
 *   scripted, exactly as a real child would have changed it between the two
 *   reads.
 * - `subagentRegistryDeps.loadAgentRuntimePluginRegistryHandle` — resolves "no
 *   plugin registry" rather than loading the plugin host. The terminal-hook code
 *   path still executes for real against an empty registry, which is what a real
 *   load would return for this config's zero configured plugins. The reason is
 *   measured, not aesthetic: the real loader compiles the plugin host through
 *   jiti synchronously and blocked the event loop for ~160s on a cold cache.
 *   Plugin-hook deferral itself is covered by unit tests, not by this script.
 *
 * WHAT IS ADVANCED RATHER THAN WAITED OUT
 * - `delivery.suspendedAt` is rewound past its hard-coded seven-day expiry.
 *   Sleeping that out is impossible. The sweeper still reads `Date.now()`
 *   itself and compares it against the real row, so the expiry branch is
 *   genuinely eligible.
 *
 * OUTPUT CADENCE AND RUNTIME
 * - Measured here: ~2 minutes end to end, of which ~95s is one cold synchronous jiti
 *   compile of a large production module graph reached by the real promotion
 *   path. That block cannot be split or yielded, so a heartbeat worker prints an
 *   `[alive]` line every 5s straight to fd 1 (see below) — no gap in this
 *   script's output exceeds ~5s, in any environment.
 * - The script exits on its own verdict rather than waiting for the registry's
 *   live timers and open session store to drain, which added ~3 minutes.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROOF DOES NOT COVER — stated plainly
 * - This is not a live isolated-Gateway run with a real child agent process. No
 *   model backend is invoked and no child agent is spawned, so "the child is
 *   still alive" is represented by its real persisted session row rather than by
 *   an OS process still doing work. The registry cannot tell the difference —
 *   that row is the only independent liveness evidence it ever consults — but
 *   the distinction is real and is not being papered over.
 * - Scenario 4 stages the child's successful stop by writing its real session
 *   row with an `endedAt` inside the deadline window after the wait already
 *   expired. That is the modelled race (the wait's snapshot missed a stop that
 *   had already happened), but the ordering is staged by this script rather than
 *   arising from a live child.
 *
 * SCENARIOS (each asserts; the script exits non-zero on any violation)
 *  1. Deadline-only expiry      — the run completes so the parent wakes, the
 *                                 outcome says `child-unconfirmed`, and the
 *                                 detached task stays NONTERMINAL.
 *  2. Continued liveness        — while the child's own row still says running,
 *                                 no `sessions.delete` is submitted, the row is
 *                                 not retired, and our guess is not stamped onto
 *                                 the child's record.
 *  3. Absent session snapshot   — a second run whose child has no session row at
 *                                 all is still not retired or deleted: absence
 *                                 of evidence is not evidence of a stop.
 *  4. Later observed completion — the child's own row reports a successful stop
 *                                 inside the deadline; the task is promoted to
 *                                 `succeeded` through the very transition a
 *                                 published `timed_out` would have blocked.
 *  5. Control (anti-vacuity)    — that same promotion attempted from a published
 *                                 `timed_out` is rejected, which is what makes
 *                                 scenario 1 load-bearing rather than cosmetic.
 *  6. Suspended-delivery expiry — a still-unconfirmed run whose final delivery
 *                                 has been suspended past its seven-day
 *                                 retention: the expiry fires and abandons the
 *                                 stale delivery, but the child's real
 *                                 attachments directory survives and the row is
 *                                 not retired. The assertion that the discard
 *                                 actually ran is what keeps this non-vacuous.
 *  7. Swarm slot retention      — a real collector in a real `maxConcurrent: 1`
 *                                 scheduler lane with a real queued sibling: the
 *                                 deadline-only expiry must NOT release the lane
 *                                 slot, so the sibling does not start beside a
 *                                 possibly-live child. The observed stop later
 *                                 releases it and the sibling runs.
 *  8. Result recapture          — the promoted run must publish the child's
 *                                 FINAL output, not the partial text frozen when
 *                                 the wait expired.
 *  9. List liveness             — the production `buildSubagentList` must show an
 *                                 unconfirmed run as live rather than filing it
 *                                 under recent timeouts while its task is still
 *                                 running.
 * 10. Cancellation at the deadline — a real `lifecycle` abort event whose
 *                                 authoritative `endedAt` equals the deadline is
 *                                 stop evidence: it must promote a row whose
 *                                 child session record is genuinely absent,
 *                                 rather than deferring cleanup forever.
 * 11. Restart reconciliation   — the rows are reloaded from the real registry
 *                                 store into a fresh map, exactly as a gateway
 *                                 restart does, and handed to the production
 *                                 `reconcileOrphanedRestoredRuns`. An
 *                                 unconfirmed row with a genuinely absent child
 *                                 session snapshot must survive; the same
 *                                 reloaded row with an observed stop must still
 *                                 be pruned.
 * 12. Resume, then promotion   — the real exported `resumeSubagentRun` must not
 *                                 delete that row either, and the child's own
 *                                 terminal session record must then promote it
 *                                 out of the provisional state. This is the
 *                                 half that shows the retention was load-
 *                                 bearing: a deleted row can never be promoted.
