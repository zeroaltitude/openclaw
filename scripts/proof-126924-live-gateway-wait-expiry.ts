/**
 * Live-Gateway proof for PR #126924 — the changed wait-expiry observation,
 * reached by real children on a real Gateway.
 *
 * Run:
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/proof-126924-live-gateway-wait-expiry.ts
 *
 * WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
 * `scripts/proof-126924-isolated-gateway.ts --control` already proves the
 * observed-stop half on a real Gateway (5/5, preserved). Its restart-recovery
 * scenario cannot reach the changed branch: restart recovery replaces the
 * interrupted run and re-anchors the successor's clock, so the successor's wait
 * expires before its own stored deadline rather than on it. This script reaches
 * the branch head-on instead, and follows the same children through to their
 * real completion.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT BEING PROVEN
 * `src/agents/subagents/registry/subagent-registry-run-wait.ts`: when a subagent
 * registry wait times out with no terminal snapshot, the stored run deadline has
 * passed, and the child's session holds no completion, the branch records a
 * NONTERMINAL `waitExpiryObservedAt` and wakes the parent with
 * `{status:"timeout", disposition:"still-running"}` instead of calling
 * `completeAsRunTimeout`. Current main terminalizes at that same point: it
 * publishes `timed_out` and runs terminal cleanup for a child that may still be
 * working — or, as here, for a child that has not started yet.
 *
 * HOW THE SCENARIO REACHES IT, WITHOUT TUNING THE PRODUCT
 * `runTimeoutSeconds` is one floored integer (`sessions_spawn`'s schema is
 * `{type:"integer"}` and `resolveConfiguredSubagentRunTimeoutSeconds` floors it)
 * that sets three things at once: the registry's stored run deadline, the
 * registry's own wait budget, and the child's hard run timeout. The wait is
 * armed inside `registerSubagentRun`, before the child's run starts. So the
 * question is only whether the child's dispatch outlasts the budget:
 *
 *   - If dispatch is fast, the child's observed start moves the deadline out and
 *     the wait expires early; the ordinary retry path then finds the child's own
 *     stop. That is the control behavior, and it is what most spawns do.
 *   - If dispatch outlasts the whole budget, the deadline is still anchored on
 *     the run's registration (`resolveSubagentRunDeadlineMs` falls back to
 *     `createdAt` for a non-collect run whose execution has no observed start),
 *     the wait expires exactly on it, and the child is genuinely not finished —
 *     here, not even started.
 *
 * The second case is an ordinary production condition: a burst of delegated work
 * on a busy Gateway with a short per-run budget. This proof reproduces it by
 * issuing several real parent turns at once, each spawning a real child with a
 * 1-second budget. No product constant is patched, no clock is faked, and no
 * assertion is relaxed; the harness only creates load and then reads the
 * Gateway's own durable state.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL
 * A real Gateway process started from `dist/entry.js` against a temp
 * `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`; real parent agent turns; the real `sessions_spawn` tool;
 * the real subagent registry, wait manager, sweeper, announce flow and
 * detached-task projection; real SQLite. Every assertion reads the Gateway's own
 * persisted rows read-only, from outside the process.
 *
 * WHAT IS STUBBED, AND ONLY THIS
 * The repository's loopback OpenAI provider
 * (`scripts/e2e/mock-openai-server.mjs`). Each parent's first turn is scripted
 * into a `sessions_spawn` call; everything else — parent wrap-ups, the children's
 * own turns, and the provisional wake turns the announce flow drives — receives
 * the same default response. No hosted model, no operator config, no live
 * Gateway, no credentials, and no network beyond loopback.
 *
 * ASSERTIONS (the script exits non-zero on any violation)
 *  1. Provisional, not terminal — `waitExpiryObservedAt` is persisted while
 *     `execution.endedAt` is unset and the detached task still reads `running`.
 *  2. Continued child activity — the same child's own run starts AFTER that
 *     observation, and its own model request reaches the provider afterwards.
 *     On current main this child has already been published `timed_out`.
 *  3. The provisional notification settles on its own — `waitExpiryAnnouncedAt`
 *     is persisted while the run is still nonterminal.
 *  4. Later final settlement and delivery — a child's real success then settles
 *     the run (`outcome.status === "ok"`), the provisional marker is retained
 *     rather than rewritten, the detached task publishes `succeeded` rather than
 *     the clock's `timed_out`, and no expired child is retired at its deadline.
 *  5. Terminal-notification RECEIPT for the same child, after its own
 *     provisional notification settled — the run reaches
 *     `delivery.status === "delivered"` with a `deliveredAt` later than its
 *     `waitExpiryAnnouncedAt`, and the requester's own turn at the provider
 *     carries the Gateway-authored terminal completion block for that exact
 *     child session (`disposition: exited` + `Stats: runtime`) at a later
 *     provider ordinal than the provisional block (`disposition:
 *     still-running`) for the same child.
 *
 * WHY 3 AND 4 NEED NOT LAND ON THE SAME CHILD — BUT 5 DOES
 * `SUBAGENT_WAIT_EXPIRY_TERMINAL_GRACE_MS` deliberately withholds the wake for a
 * moment so an authoritative terminal can win. A child whose own stop lands
 * inside that grace therefore gets no provisional wake at all — which is the
 * intended behavior, not a gap — while a child still unfinished after it does.
 * The burst exercises both halves in one run, and the assertions say which.
 * Assertion 4 is therefore drawn from the expired set. Assertion 5 is the
 * narrower claim and is deliberately same-child: it starts from the children
 * that actually got a provisional wake and requires each candidate's OWN
 * terminal notification, matched by child session key and ordered by the
 * provider's own arrival ordinal.
 *
 * WHY THE RECEIPT IS NOT THIS HARNESS'S BOOKKEEPING
 * Both halves of assertion 5 are written by production code: the delivery
 * receipt comes from the completion-delivery path, which credits `delivered`
 * only from a transport result, and the completion-event block is authored by
 * the Gateway and reaches the provider only because it was delivered into that
 * requester's session. The provisional wake is measured to leave delivery
 * `pending` with no `deliveredAt`, which is asserted rather than assumed, so a
 * receipt stamped after `waitExpiryAnnouncedAt` cannot be the provisional one.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL
 * Revert the `if (!isTerminalWaitTimeout) { … reportSubagentWaitExpiry … }`
 * branch in `subagent-registry-run-wait.ts` so a bare deadline expiry falls
 * through to `completeAsRunTimeout` — that is current main's behavior — rebuild,
 * and re-run. Assertion 1 can no longer be satisfied by any child and the script
 * fails at "no child reached the nonterminal wait-expiry observation"; with no
 * provisional notification anywhere, assertion 5's ordered pair is unreachable
 * too.
