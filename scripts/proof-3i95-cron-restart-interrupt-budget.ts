/**
 * Real-behavior proof for openclaw-3i95: gateway restarts must not auto-disable
 * a healthy recurring automation.
 *
 * Real (not stubbed):
 * - The production `CronService` facade and its real `start()` startup repair,
 *   which is what detects a persisted `running` marker and calls
 *   `markInterruptedStartupRun`.
 * - The real on-disk cron store (`loadCronStore` / `saveCronStore`) under a temp
 *   dir, so every restart round-trips job state through real persistence. This
 *   also proves the new report-only state fields survive the store, rather than
 *   living only in memory.
 * - The real `applyJobResult` run-outcome path and the real
 *   `maybeAutoDisableCronJobAfterRunFailure` budget decision.
 *
 * Stubbed only at the edge:
 * - `runIsolatedAgentJob` / `enqueueSystemEvent` / `requestHeartbeat` are inert
 *   so the proof never launches an agent turn or delivers a notification. The
 *   scheduler is left paused, so no job is executed by wall-clock; every run
 *   outcome in this proof is applied explicitly.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *  1. Twelve consecutive gateway restarts interrupt a running `every` job.
 *     Before the fix this reached `consecutiveErrors = 10` and auto-disabled at
 *     the tenth restart. It must now stay enabled, with the interruption streak
 *     recorded separately and the last run marked `gateway-restart`.
 *  2. Nine genuine run failures, then a restart interruption, then a tenth
 *     genuine failure. The restart must not pay for a failure: the job survives
 *     the interruption and is auto-disabled only by the tenth real failure, and
 *     the recorded `autoDisabled.consecutiveErrors` counts real failures only.
 *  3. A job with no interruptions in its streak auto-disables on its tenth
 *     genuine failure exactly as before, proving the regression direction.
 *  4. A run that reports its own outcome clears the interruption streak, so
 *     restarts cannot accumulate across healthy runs.
 *
 * Run: pnpm tsx scripts/proof-3i95-cron-restart-interrupt-budget.ts
